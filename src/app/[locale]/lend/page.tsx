  {
    value: "stable-1",
    question: "Is my capital safe?",
    answer:
      "All loans are overcollateralized, and borrowers must remain above the required health threshold. If a position becomes unsafe, liquidation begins automatically through a controlled process designed to protect lender capital and contain losses within that market.",
  },
  {
    value: "stable-2",
    question: "Where does my yield come from?",
    answer:
      "Your yield comes from interest paid by LP backed borrowers. Rates are driven by base utilization at the Aave v4 Hub, with additional Spoke premiums reflecting the risk profile of the LP collateral being funded.",
  },
  {
    value: "stable-3",
    question: "How is this different from supplying to Aave directly?",
    answer:
      "Avana is built on Aave v4 and uses its Hub for liquidity, but it serves a different borrower class. Instead of standard token collateral, Avana enables LP positions as collateral, which creates new borrowing demand and expands yield opportunities for suppliers.",
  },
  {
    value: "stable-4",
    question: "Can I withdraw at any time?",
    answer:
      "Yes, as long as there is sufficient available liquidity in the market. There are no lockups. If utilization is very high, withdrawals may depend on repayments or new liquidity entering the system.",
  },
  {
    value: "stable-5",
    question: "What assets can I supply?",
    answer:
      "At launch, supported assets include GHO, USDC, USDT, ETH, and WBTC, with additional assets added through governance over time. New listings prioritize liquidity depth, reliable oracle support, and strong market demand.",
  },
  {
    value: "stable-6",
    question: "Why can yields be higher than standard lending markets?",
    answer:
      "Avana adds LP specific borrower demand on top of the shared Hub liquidity layer. That demand can increase utilization and support an additional risk premium, which gives suppliers access to yield that standard lending markets may not capture.",
  },
